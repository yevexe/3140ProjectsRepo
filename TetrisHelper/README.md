Project Idea (First Draft):
A popular website used for playing Tetris over the browser named Jstris contains a public API that 
contains information about the user, and information about each game that they play. Using this 
information, my idea is to create a website that takes the name of a user on Jstris and have the 
website tell them important information about each of their matches and what they can possibly do 
to get better at Tetris
